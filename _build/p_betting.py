<div class="prose">
<p>On <b>28 June 2025</b> the <b>Racing Industry Amendment Act 2025</b> came into force. It makes
<b>TAB NZ the only entity that may lawfully offer or promote sports and racing betting to a person in New
Zealand</b>.</p>
<p>That is a significant change and a great many comparison pages still describe the previous position. So,
precisely:</p>
<h3>What the Act does</h3>
<ul>
<li>It prohibits any operator other than TAB NZ from <b>offering</b> betting services to people in New
Zealand.</li>
<li>It prohibits <b>promoting</b> those services to people in New Zealand &mdash; a word broad enough to
capture advertising, sponsorship and, arguably, affiliate marketing.</li>
<li>It gives the Department of Internal Affairs enforcement tools including payment blocking and ISP-level
measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What the Act does not do</h3>
<p><b>It does not make it an offence for you to place a bet.</b> No New Zealand law criminalises the
individual punter, and nothing in the 2025 Act changes that. If you hold an account with an offshore
sportsbook and bet on it, you commit no offence. The prohibition binds the supply side.</p>
{note('<p><b>Our own position, since you should know it.</b> This page describes offshore sportsbooks and '
      'links to them, and we are paid when you register. The Act&rsquo;s prohibition on <i>promoting</i> '
      'offshore betting to New Zealanders is capable of applying to a page like this one. We think you are '
      'better served by an accurate description of the legal position and the market than by silence, but '
      'you should read this page knowing both what the law says and what our commercial interest is.</p>',
      "warn")}
<h3>What it means in practice</h3>
<p>You have no domestic recourse. If an offshore book voids a bet, restricts your account or refuses a "
withdrawal, TAB NZ&rsquo;s regulator cannot help you and neither can the DIA. Your escalation route is
whichever offshore regulator licensed the operator &mdash; in almost every case the Cura&ccedil;ao Gaming
Control Board. That is a real reduction in protection and it should weigh in the decision.</p>
</div>''', ident="law")}

{sec(f'''{sechead("TAB NZ versus the offshore books, honestly", None, 2, "tab")}
<div class="prose">
<p>Most affiliate pages skip this comparison because TAB NZ pays no commission. It is the only lawful
option for New Zealanders, so skipping it is not defensible.</p>
<h3>Where TAB NZ is genuinely better</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>It is lawful, and it is regulated here.</b> A dispute goes to a New Zealand body under New Zealand
law. Nothing offshore offers an equivalent.</li>
<li><b>Racing.</b> TAB NZ runs the domestic tote and carries depth on New Zealand thoroughbred, harness
and greyhound racing that no offshore book comes close to matching.</li>
<li><b>Domestic codes.</b> Netball, domestic cricket and the lower New Zealand football grades get real
markets rather than a token line.</li>
<li><b>Your money funds New Zealand sport.</b> TAB NZ distributions go back into the racing industry and
national sporting organisations. Whether that matters to you is a personal question, but it is true and it
is never mentioned on affiliate pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where the offshore books are better</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Margins on international sport.</b> Four to five percent better on EPL and NBA head-to-heads, which
compounds substantially over a season.</li>
<li><b>Market depth on international fixtures</b> &mdash; player props, alternate lines and in-play
coverage that TAB NZ does not attempt.</li>
<li><b>Promotions.</b> TAB NZ is constrained in what it can offer; offshore books are not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
{margins}
<div class="prose">
<p>Read the table as a cost, because that is what it is. A 107% overround against a 104% overround means
roughly NZ$3 per NZ$100 staked. A bettor turning over NZ$10,000 in a season is paying about NZ$300 more for
the same bets. That is the honest case for offshore books on international sport, and it is real.</p>
<p>It is also the entire case. On racing, on domestic codes and on every dimension of consumer protection,
the comparison runs the other way.</p>
</div>''', ident="tab", haze=True)}

{sec(f'''{sechead("Racing is not a close call")}
<div class="prose">
<p>Worth separating out, because the answer is unusually clear.</p>
<p>New Zealand racing betting runs on a <b>totalisator</b> &mdash; a pool system where all stakes go into a
pool, TAB NZ takes a statutory deduction, and the remainder is divided among winners. The takeout is
around 15% on win pools, which is high compared with a fixed-odds sports margin.</p>
<p>But offshore books mostly do not offer New Zealand racing at all, and where they do the markets are
thin, the limits are low and the prices are derived from the tote anyway. There is no meaningful
alternative to compare against.</p>
<p>So for New Zealand racing: <b>use TAB NZ.</b> It is lawful, it is where the liquidity is, it is where
the depth is, and the deduction funds the industry producing the racing you are betting on. We earn nothing
from saying this.</p>
</div>''', ident="racing")}

{sec(f'''{sechead("How to read a price, which is worth more than any tip")}
<div class="prose">
<p>The single most useful skill in betting, and almost never taught on pages like this one.</p>
<h3>Converting odds to probability</h3>
<p>Divide 1 by the decimal odds. A price of 2.50 implies 1 &divide; 2.50 = <b>40%</b>. A price of 1.80
implies 55.6%. That is what the bookmaker is telling you it thinks, plus its margin.</p>
<h3>Finding the overround</h3>
<p>Add the implied probabilities of every outcome. In a fair market they would sum to 100%. In a real one
they sum to more, and the excess is the bookmaker&rsquo;s margin.</p>
<p>A head-to-head priced at 1.90 and 1.90 gives 52.6% + 52.6% = <b>105.2%</b>, so the margin is 5.2%. The
same match at 1.95 and 1.95 gives 102.6% &mdash; a 2.6% margin, half the cost to you. Identical bet,
different price, and the difference is invisible unless you do the arithmetic.</p>
<h3>Why this beats tipping</h3>
<p>Nobody can reliably tell you who will win. Everybody can tell, in ten seconds, which book is charging
less for the same opinion. Over a season, consistently taking the better of two prices is worth more than
any run of good selections, and unlike selections it is entirely within your control.</p>
{note('<p><b>The one number to remember.</b> A 1.90 / 1.90 market costs you 5.2%. A 1.95 / 1.95 market '
      'costs you 2.6%. If you do nothing else, compare the head-to-head price across two books before '
      'every bet.</p>', "info")}

{sec(f'''{sechead("Payments, currency and getting paid")}

<p>The practical mechanics, which differ from casino play in one important way: sports balances tend to sit
for longer, so currency costs bite harder.</p>
<p><b>Currency.</b> <a href="/casino-reviews/rooster-bet/">Rooster Bet</a> and

{B.FX_SPREAD*100:.1f}% across the round trip. On a balance you top up and withdraw from repeatedly through
a season, that adds up faster than most people expect.</p>
<p><b>Deposits.</b> New Zealand banks increasingly decline gambling merchant codes on cards. POLi is the
most reliable domestic route; crypto bypasses the banking question entirely and is supported by three of
the four books here.</p>
<p><b>Withdrawals.</b> The weekly cap governs a large win exactly as it does at a casino &mdash; Gunsbet&rsquo;s
&euro;4,000 ceiling is the tightest here. Verify your account when you open it rather than when you win.

{sec(f'''{sechead("Betting responsibly, and the specific risk in sport")}
<div class="prose">
<p>Sports betting carries a risk that casino play does not, and it is worth naming: <b>it feels like a
skill.</b> You follow the game, you know the players, you have a view. That sense of competence is real
about the sport and largely illusory about the market, which is priced by people doing it full time with
better information.</p>
<p>The specific patterns to watch for are in-play betting, which compresses decisions into seconds, and
chasing a losing day with a large bet on a late fixture. Both are where a manageable habit becomes an
unmanageable one.</p>

bet you make, forever.</p>

<p>Three to four percentage points of overround is worth roughly NZ$35&ndash;40 per NZ$1,000 you turn over.
A bettor staking NZ$200 a week across a season &mdash; about NZ$10,000 of turnover &mdash; is paying
somewhere near <b>NZ$350 extra</b> at the wider price. That is the real, compounding case for shopping
around, and it is larger than any welcome offer on this page.</p>

wins, and we earn nothing for saying so.</p>
