"""The Ledger: what a welcome offer actually costs to clear.

Every figure on this site that carries a dollar sign is produced here, from the
operator's own published headline and wagering basis. Nothing is estimated from
a rate card and nothing is copied from an operator's marketing.

The arithmetic is deliberately simple so a reader can check it:

    turnover = multiplier x base
    expected cost = turnover x (1 - RTP)

`base` is whatever the operator says it is. "40x bonus" multiplies the bonus.
"10x deposit + bonus" multiplies both, which is the more expensive basis and the
one operators tend not to draw attention to. Where an offer states a total match
percentage we can recover the qualifying deposit from the cap, which is the only
way to price a "deposit + bonus" requirement honestly.

FX is applied at a published, dated rate. A euro-denominated bonus is not worth
its face value to a New Zealander and pretending otherwise is the single most
common error on competing pages.
